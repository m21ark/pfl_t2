minmax:
* Generate all possible moves from this situation.
* If no such move exists this situation means an ended game, and the active player loses. Return a value (1000/-1000 depending if it was the min or max players turn)
* If possible moves exist, call minmax for the situation of the board after each move.
* When all the subsequent calls returned, chose the one with the highest/lowest score, and return it.
